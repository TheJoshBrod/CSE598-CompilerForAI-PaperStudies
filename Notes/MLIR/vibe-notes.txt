Why MLIR was created: to reduce fragmentation in software tooling, support compilation for different kinds of hardware (like CPUs, GPUs, accelerators), and make it cheaper and easier to build domain-specific compilers.
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs dig into the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of MLIR.

MLIR was created to solve those problems (fragmentation, heterogeneous hardware, expensive compiler development) by introducing a flexible and extensible intermediate representation framework. Here‚Äôs how it addresses each point:

1. Reducing Software Fragmentation
Traditionally, every domain-specific language (DSL) or compiler framework reinvents its own intermediate representation (IR).

MLIR provides a shared, reusable infrastructure where different projects can define and compose their own dialects (custom IRs).

This means tools don‚Äôt need to be rebuilt from scratch‚Äîprojects can share passes, optimizations, and infrastructure.

2. Supporting Compilation for Heterogeneous Hardware
Modern systems combine CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, and more. Writing separate compilers for each is expensive.

MLIR supports multi-level abstractions, so you can:

Write high-level transformations close to the programming model.

Gradually lower them into hardware-specific representations.

For example: A tensor operation can first be represented abstractly, optimized at the math level, then lowered step by step into GPU kernels or CPU vector instructions.

3. Lowering the Cost of Building Domain-Specific Compilers
With MLIR, compiler writers don‚Äôt need to start from scratch. They can:

Define a dialect for their domain-specific language (e.g., machine learning, linear algebra, quantum computing).

Reuse MLIR‚Äôs existing optimization passes, type system, and code generation infrastructure.

This modular approach means you only implement the unique parts of your language or domain while relying on the shared MLIR backbone for the rest.

4. Connecting Existing Compilers Together
MLIR acts like a bridge between different IRs and compilers (e.g., LLVM, TensorFlow XLA, ONNX).

It can translate between levels of abstraction, allowing high-level compilers to plug into low-level code generators.

Example: TensorFlow can lower its graph IR into MLIR, then MLIR lowers to LLVM IR for CPU codegen or to GPU-specific backends.

üëâ In short:
MLIR solves these challenges by being multi-level, extensible, and modular, allowing compiler components to be reused, connected, and specialized instead of rebuilt for every project or hardware target.

Would you like me to illustrate this with a concrete example, say how a TensorFlow operation (like a matrix multiply) flows through MLIR levels down to hardware?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through a concrete example: compiling a matrix multiplication (matmul) operation from TensorFlow using MLIR.

Step 1: High-Level TensorFlow Graph
In TensorFlow, you might write:

C = tf.matmul(A, B)
At this point, it‚Äôs represented as a high-level graph op (something like tf.MatMul).

Step 2: MLIR TensorFlow Dialect
MLIR has a TensorFlow dialect that captures this directly:

%0 = "tf.MatMul"(%A, %B) {transpose_a = false, transpose_b = false} : (tensor<...>, tensor<...>) -> tensor<...>
This still looks very close to TensorFlow, but it‚Äôs now inside MLIR, which means it can use MLIR‚Äôs passes and infrastructure.

Step 3: MLIR Linear Algebra Dialect (Linalg)
We lower the high-level op into a more structured linalg dialect:

%0 = linalg.matmul ins(%A, %B : tensor<...>, tensor<...>) -> tensor<...>
This expresses the same computation, but in a form that can be systematically optimized (e.g., tiling, fusion, loop transformations).

Step 4: MLIR Loop / Affine Dialect
The matmul is lowered into explicit loops over indices:

affine.for %i = 0 to M {
  affine.for %j = 0 to N {
    affine.for %k = 0 to K {
      %c = load %C[%i, %j]
      %a = load %A[%i, %k]
      %b = load %B[%k, %j]
      %prod = mulf %a, %b
      %sum = addf %c, %prod
      store %sum, %C[%i, %j]
    }
  }
}
Now the computation is explicit, enabling optimizations like vectorization, parallelization, and loop tiling.

Step 5: Lowering to LLVM or GPU Dialects
If targeting a CPU, this can be lowered into LLVM IR and compiled to machine code.

If targeting a GPU, MLIR can lower into GPU dialects (e.g., CUDA kernels, SPIR-V for Vulkan). Example GPU lowering might assign each (i, j) iteration to a GPU thread.

Step 6: Execution
Finally, the optimized, hardware-specific code runs on the chosen backend (CPU, GPU, TPU, etc.).

üîë Key Insight: MLIR allows the same high-level TensorFlow operation to be lowered step by step into different forms, while reusing optimizations and infrastructure at each level. Instead of writing separate compilers for CPU, GPU, and TPU, MLIR provides one flexible path with modular lowering.

Do you want me to make a diagram that visually shows this flow (from TensorFlow graph ‚Üí MLIR dialects ‚Üí hardware code)?

You said:
So what is MILR specifically doing here? My understanding is that it's just the framework to make new IRs?
ChatGPT said:
You‚Äôve got the key idea ‚Äî MLIR is not ‚Äújust another IR‚Äù, it‚Äôs a framework for building IRs (and connecting them). Let me unpack this in the context of your TensorFlow matmul example:

What MLIR is
A compiler infrastructure for defining, transforming, and lowering multiple IRs.

Unlike LLVM IR (which is one fixed, low-level IR), MLIR lets you create dialects: custom IRs that match the right abstraction level for your domain (e.g., TensorFlow ops, linear algebra ops, affine loops, GPU kernels).

What MLIR is doing in practice
Hosting Multiple Levels of Representation

TensorFlow ops live in the TensorFlow dialect.

More math-y representations live in the Linalg dialect.

Structured loops live in the Affine/SCF dialects.

Low-level code lives in the LLVM or GPU dialects.
üëâ MLIR allows all these dialects to co-exist and be transformed step-by-step.

Providing Shared Infrastructure

Parsing, verification, type checking.

Generic optimization passes (e.g., common subexpression elimination, dead code elimination).

Lowering and translation utilities.
üëâ Instead of rebuilding this for each new IR, you get it ‚Äúfor free‚Äù in MLIR.

Making Lowering Explicit and Modular

Each transformation (e.g., TensorFlow ‚Üí Linalg ‚Üí Affine ‚Üí LLVM) is expressed as dialect-to-dialect lowering.

You can swap, add, or reuse parts of the pipeline depending on your target hardware.

Connecting to Existing Compilers

MLIR lowers to LLVM IR for CPUs.

MLIR lowers to SPIR-V, CUDA, ROCm dialects for GPUs.

MLIR integrates with TensorFlow XLA and ONNX.
üëâ It acts as the glue layer between high-level frameworks and low-level compilers.

So in your matmul example:
MLIR itself isn‚Äôt performing the matmul or even inventing a new way to represent it.

What it does is provide:

The TensorFlow dialect to represent it at a high level.

The Linalg/Affine dialects to systematically lower it into loops.

The infrastructure to then lower that into LLVM or GPU code.

In other words: MLIR is the scaffolding that makes it easy to create, connect, and transform these IRs without reinventing a compiler from scratch every time.

‚úÖ Your summary could be:

MLIR is not a single IR, but a framework for building and composing multiple IRs (dialects). It provides reusable infrastructure for transformations, optimizations, and lowering, making it easier to connect high-level domain-specific operations to low-level hardware-specific code.

Do you want me to show how MLIR differs from LLVM IR directly (side-by-side comparison) so it‚Äôs crystal clear why it‚Äôs a framework and not just ‚Äúanother IR‚Äù?

You said:
What does MLIR framework do to allow users to make new IRs?
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî this is the heart of why MLIR exists.

MLIR‚Äôs framework provides the infrastructure and abstractions so you can define new intermediate representations (IRs), called dialects, without rebuilding a whole compiler backend from scratch.

Here‚Äôs what it gives you:

üîë 1. Dialect System (Custom IRs)
You can create a dialect, which is like a ‚Äúnamespace‚Äù for your IR.

A dialect defines:

Ops (operations): e.g., mydialect.matmul, mydialect.conv2d.

Types: e.g., tensor<4x4xf32>, or your own custom type like quantized_tensor.

Attributes: metadata on ops, like transpose flags or padding sizes.

This means you don‚Äôt have to hack an existing IR ‚Äî you declare your own operations cleanly.

üîë 2. Operation Definition Framework (ODS)
MLIR provides a declarative language (TableGen) to define ops, types, and constraints.

Example: Instead of writing boilerplate C++ to define a matmul op, you write a spec that MLIR uses to auto-generate verification, parsing, and printing code.

This drastically lowers the cost of defining a new IR.

üîë 3. Infrastructure for Transformations
MLIR gives you pass management and transformation tools so your new dialect can:

Optimize ops (e.g., fuse, tile, vectorize).

Lower into another dialect.

Reuse existing generic passes (like dead-code elimination or inlining).

You don‚Äôt need to re-implement the compiler ‚Äúplumbing.‚Äù

üîë 4. Multi-Level IR Coexistence
Your new dialect doesn‚Äôt live in isolation. It can coexist with others:

TensorFlow ops can sit next to your custom ops.

You can lower your dialect into existing ones like linalg, affine, or LLVM.

This is what allows progressive lowering ‚Äî gradually moving from high-level abstractions to low-level code.

üîë 5. Integration with Existing Ecosystem
Built-in paths to LLVM IR, SPIR-V, GPU backends, etc.

This means your new dialect automatically gets a way to connect with real hardware.

‚úÖ In Short
MLIR allows users to make new IRs by giving them:

A dialect mechanism for defining custom ops, types, and attributes.

Declarative tools (ODS) to auto-generate boilerplate.

A shared optimization and pass infrastructure.

A way to compose dialects together and progressively lower.

Backend connections to LLVM, GPUs, and accelerators.

üëâ Without MLIR, you‚Äôd need to hand-build all of this (parsers, verifiers, optimizers, lowerings, backend codegen). With MLIR, you just define your domain‚Äôs special sauce, and reuse the rest.

Would you like me to show a tiny real example of defining a custom MLIR op (like a mydialect.add operation) so you can see concretely what ‚Äúmaking a new IR‚Äù looks like?

You said:
What does this mean - You don‚Äôt need to re-implement the compiler "plumbing"
ChatGPT said:
Ah, good catch ‚Äî that phrase can sound a bit vague. Let‚Äôs make it concrete.

When I said MLIR saves you from re-implementing the compiler ‚Äúplumbing,‚Äù I meant all the boilerplate, infrastructure, and utilities that every compiler project needs, regardless of what the actual language or hardware is.

üîß Examples of ‚ÄúPlumbing‚Äù a compiler usually needs:
IR Representation

Data structures for operations, types, attributes.

Printing, parsing, and serialization.

Verification

Rules like ‚Äúa matmul op must take two tensors of matching inner dimensions.‚Äù

Pass Management

Infrastructure for running optimizations in a pipeline.

Debugging and profiling of passes.

Generic Optimizations

Dead code elimination, common subexpression elimination, inlining.

Lowering Infrastructure

Mechanisms to translate one IR into another (e.g., from high-level ops to loops).

Integration with Backends

Converting to LLVM IR for CPUs or SPIR-V for GPUs.

üü¢ Without MLIR
If you wanted to build a new domain-specific compiler, you‚Äôd have to write all of that by hand:

Create your own IR classes.

Build a parser and printer.

Write verification logic for every op.

Write your own pass manager.

Implement common optimizations yourself.

Build translation layers to target machine code.

That‚Äôs years of engineering effort, even before you get to the ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù part (your custom language logic).

üü¢ With MLIR
You only define what‚Äôs unique to your domain (your dialect ‚Äî its ops, types, semantics).
MLIR gives you all the plumbing:

Auto-generated parser, printer, and verifier from declarative definitions.

A ready-made pass manager and optimizer framework.

Existing lowering paths into LLVM IR, GPU IRs, etc.

Libraries of reusable transformations (tiling, vectorization, loop optimizations).

So instead of rebuilding the pipes and wiring of a compiler, you just plug your domain-specific pieces into MLIR‚Äôs infrastructure.

‚úÖ So:

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to re-implement the compiler plumbing‚Äù means MLIR already provides all the common, boring, but essential parts of compiler infrastructure. You focus on defining your new IR (dialect) and domain-specific logic, while MLIR takes care of the rest.

Would you like me to sketch a before vs after diagram ‚Äî showing what a traditional compiler developer has to build vs what MLIR gives you ‚Äúfor free‚Äù?

You said:
What are limitations of MLIR?
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî MLIR is powerful, but it isn‚Äôt a silver bullet. Since it‚Äôs still relatively new and ambitious, there are a number of limitations and challenges people have pointed out.

Here are the key ones:

üî¥ Limitations of MLIR
1. Complexity & Steep Learning Curve
MLIR is very flexible (dialects, multiple IR levels, declarative definitions).

That flexibility makes it hard to learn and reason about ‚Äî newcomers must understand:

Dialects and their interactions.

Multi-level lowering strategies.

Operation Definition Specification (ODS) and TableGen.

For smaller projects, MLIR can feel like overkill.

2. Not a Replacement for All Compiler Work
MLIR doesn‚Äôt handle everything out of the box:

You still need to design your semantics and optimizations for your custom IR.

MLIR won‚Äôt magically generate an efficient compiler ‚Äî it gives you the scaffolding.

So while you save time on the ‚Äúplumbing,‚Äù you still need significant engineering effort.

3. Performance Tuning is Non-Trivial
Having many levels of IR (TensorFlow ‚Üí Linalg ‚Üí Affine ‚Üí LLVM, etc.) is powerful‚Ä¶

But each lowering step introduces complexity and requires careful tuning to get good performance.

In practice, lowering pipelines can become very long and brittle.

4. Ecosystem Maturity
MLIR is still evolving ‚Äî the dialect ecosystem is uneven.

Some dialects are well-developed (Linalg, Affine, LLVM).

Others are experimental or not standardized.

This makes interoperability harder and can lead to fragmentation inside MLIR itself, ironically one of the problems it was meant to solve.

5. Debugging & Tooling Challenges
Debugging across multiple dialects and transformations is tricky.

Tooling (IDE integration, error messages, debuggers) is less mature compared to older infrastructures like LLVM.

This can slow down development when pipelines are complex.

6. Trade-offs of Generality
Because MLIR is general-purpose, it may not always be the most efficient solution for highly specialized domains.

For some small DSLs or narrow compilers, a custom hand-rolled IR might actually be simpler and faster to build.

7. Integration with Legacy Systems
While MLIR is designed to connect compilers, integrating it into existing large systems (like GCC or mature proprietary toolchains) can be non-trivial.

It often requires re-architecting parts of the toolchain.

‚úÖ In Short
MLIR‚Äôs limitations are:

It‚Äôs complex and has a steep learning curve.

It doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for domain-specific work.

Performance tuning and debugging across multiple IR levels is hard.

The ecosystem is still maturing.

For small/simple compilers, it can be over-engineering.

Would you like me to compare MLIR‚Äôs limitations vs LLVM‚Äôs limitations (since LLVM is the traditional alternative) so you can see where MLIR improves things and where it struggles?

You said:
Is MLIR the leading infrastructure of its type or does it have competitors?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question ‚Äî MLIR looks very dominant if you‚Äôre following modern compiler research, but it‚Äôs not the only approach out there. Let‚Äôs situate it in context.

‚úÖ Is MLIR the leading infrastructure?
Yes ‚Äî right now, MLIR is the most influential and widely adopted multi-level IR framework.

It was originally developed at Google (for TensorFlow/XLA).

Adopted into LLVM (official subproject) in 2019, which gave it a strong ecosystem.

Used by TensorFlow, PyTorch, IREE, ONNX-MLIR, XLA, and many ML/AI accelerators.

It‚Äôs not just for ML ‚Äî people are exploring it in quantum computing, hardware synthesis, and other domains.

Because of its flexibility and backing by LLVM, it has become the de facto choice for building new compiler infrastructures today.

üîÑ Competitors / Alternatives
There are other projects and approaches, but none are quite as general-purpose as MLIR.

1. LLVM IR (traditional)
Before MLIR, most compilers used LLVM IR directly.

LLVM IR is excellent for low-level optimizations and codegen, but not well-suited for high-level representations (e.g., tensors, ML graphs).

MLIR was partly created to fix this gap.
üëâ So LLVM IR is more of a predecessor than a competitor.

2. TVM (Apache TVM / Relay IR)
A machine learning compiler stack with its own Relay IR.

Focused on deep learning and auto-tuning for heterogeneous hardware.

Competes with MLIR in ML specifically, but not as general-purpose.
üëâ Some projects even integrate MLIR with TVM.

3. XLA HLO (TensorFlow)
TensorFlow‚Äôs old High-Level Optimizer IR.

Purpose-built for ML computations, especially for TPUs.

Being gradually replaced by MLIR-based dialects.
üëâ You could think of MLIR as the ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù beyond HLO.

4. Glow (by Meta/Facebook)
Neural network compiler with its own IR.

Optimized for inference on CPUs and accelerators.

Focused narrowly on ML, not general compiler infrastructure.

5. ML-focused IRs (like ONNX IR, nGraph IR, etc.)
Framework-specific IRs to represent ML graphs.

Typically not reusable outside their ecosystem.

Many of these are now moving toward MLIR integration.

6. Rust-based and Academic Projects
Some research projects explore multi-level IRs or modular compiler frameworks in Rust (e.g., Cranelift, Egg for equality saturation).

Interesting, but far less mature or widespread compared to MLIR.

üîë Bottom line
MLIR is the leader in this space because it is:

General-purpose (not just ML).

Backed by LLVM.

Actively adopted in industry (Google, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, etc.).

Competitors like TVM, HLO, Glow, ONNX IR exist, but most are domain-specific (focused on machine learning).

In fact, many of those projects are moving toward MLIR as a foundation instead of building parallel infrastructures.

Would you like me to make a comparison table (MLIR vs TVM vs HLO vs Glow vs LLVM IR) so you can quickly see strengths and weaknesses side by side?
