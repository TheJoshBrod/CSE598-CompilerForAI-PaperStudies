We introduce GEAK framework, a modular, agent-based system that uses inference-time compute scaling with frontier LLMs to generate Triton GPU kernels from minimal task descriptions. GEAK incorporates multiple agents—generation, evaluation, reflection, and optimization—to iteratively refine code quality and execution performance.

So is GEAK iteratively making optimizations during runtime or is pre-runtime compilation?
ChatGPT said:
GEAK’s “iterative” process happens before a final kernel is adopted—it’s not dynamically rewriting or recompiling kernels during execution.

✅ What’s actually happening
The framework uses frontier LLMs plus a multi-agent loop (generation → evaluation → reflection → optimization) to iteratively improve a candidate Triton kernel. That loop is an inference-time, pre-deployment process:

The agents generate a kernel from a short prompt.

They benchmark or analyze it (often by compiling and running small tests).

Based on that feedback, they revise the code.

The cycle repeats until a satisfactory version emerges.

Once a final kernel is chosen, it’s compiled and used like any other Triton kernel.

❌ What it does not do
It does not:

Re-optimize kernels during long-running execution.

Perform hot-swapping or JIT tuning at runtime based on changing inputs.

Continue agent loops after deployment.

TL;DR
GEAK performs pre-runtime, inference-time iterative optimization—not live runtime optimization.

You said:
We establish two benchmark suites for evaluating Triton kernel generation. The TritonBench-revised is a
revised subset of 184 kernels adapted from TritonBench-G[1] with stricter testing harnesses. In addition, we
release the ROCm Triton Benchmark, a new suite of 30 real-world kernels sampled from open-source AMD
ROCm repositories

Explain how this benchmark suite is used?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s how those two benchmark suites fit into the GEAK evaluation pipeline:

✅ 1. What the suites are for
They serve as ground-truth tasks to test how well GEAK (or other systems) can generate correct and performant Triton GPU kernels from minimal descriptions.

✅ 2. How each suite is structured and used
A. TritonBench-revised (184 kernels)
Based on TritonBench-G but cleaned up and standardized.

Each benchmark has:

A short task description or reference implementation.

A strict correctness test harness (e.g., unit tests, shape checks, numerical comparison).

Usage:

GEAK attempts to generate a kernel for each benchmark from the description.

Correctness is validated automatically.

Performance (e.g., runtime, throughput) is measured after correctness is satisfied.

This suite gives breadth—it tests generalization across many kernel types.

B. ROCm Triton Benchmark (30 kernels)
Selected from real AMD ROCm repos and adapted into Triton-compatible tasks.

These kernels reflect real-world patterns (e.g., fused ops, ML workloads, tensor transforms).

Usage:

Same loop: generation → validation → performance profiling.

Compared against human-written ROCm/Triton baselines when available.

This suite gives realism—it measures how GEAK performs on authentic production tasks, not just synthetic ones.

✅ 3. What’s measured with both suites
For each task in both suites, GEAK is evaluated on:

✔️ Success rate
Did it produce a kernel that passes all correctness tests?

✔️ Performance
How fast is the generated kernel vs. the baseline (or a reference CPU/GPU impl)?

✔️ Iteration efficiency
How many generation–refinement cycles were needed?

✔️ Generalization
How often does the system solve an unseen benchmark without needing task-specific hints?

✅ 4. Why two separate suites?
Suite	Size	Source	Purpose
TritonBench-revised	184	Adapted synthetic tasks	Coverage & systematic testing
ROCm Triton Benchmark	30	Real AMD repos	Real-world performance & viability
Using both gives a balanced evaluation: scalability + realism.

If you want, I can also walk you through how a single benchmark task flows through GEAK’s agent pipeline—just say the word!

You said:
Can you explain how it fits in that GEAK pipeline
ChatGPT said:
Sure — here’s how a single benchmark task (from either TritonBench-revised or the ROCm suite) moves through the GEAK pipeline and how each agent interacts with it:

✅ 1. Task Selection (Benchmark as Input)
A benchmark provides:

A minimal task description (e.g., “fused softmax over last dim”)

The expected I/O signature

A correctness harness (unit tests, shape & dtype checks, numerical tolerances)

This serves as the starting point for the pipeline.

✅ 2. Generation Agent
Takes the benchmark description + spec.

Produces an initial Triton kernel.

Output is raw code — no guarantees yet.

Why the benchmark matters:
Each benchmark defines exactly what needs to be generated.

✅ 3. Evaluation Agent
Two checks happen here:

✅ A. Correctness
The code is compiled and run through the benchmark’s test harness.

If it fails to compile or produces wrong output → flagged.

✅ B. Performance (if correct)
Runs microbenchmarks to time the kernel or compare against a baseline.

Why the benchmark matters:
All of the validation comes from benchmark-provided tests—GEAK doesn’t invent the checks.

✅ 4. Reflection Agent
If the evaluation failed or performance is subpar:

It analyzes compiler errors, test mismatches, or performance metrics.

Generates feedback like:

“Out-of-bounds index”

“Inefficient memory tiling”

“Kernel launch params too small”

Passes that guidance back to the generation loop.

Benchmark role:
The errors and mismatches come directly from the benchmark’s ground-truth harness.

✅ 5. Optimization Agent (optional/iterative)
For correct-but-slow kernels:

Suggests tuning or transformations (e.g., BLOCK_SIZE tweaks, warp tiling, fusion).

Produces revised code.

Sends it back to evaluation for re-testing.

This loop continues until:

A correct + performant kernel is produced, or

A cap on iterations is reached.

✅ 6. Final Scoring (per benchmark)
For that benchmark, GEAK logs:

✅ Pass/fail correctness

⚡ Speed vs baseline

🔁 Number of refinement rounds

🕒 Time/cycles to success

All benchmarks in the suite are processed like this individually.

✅ 7. Aggregate Reporting
Once all tasks in the suite are processed:

Success rate over all benchmarks

Avg and best speedups

Distribution of iteration counts

Performance consistency on diverse benchmarks

Results from TritonBench-revised and ROCm benchmarks can also be compared separately to measure:

General-purpose capability vs real-world viability

TL;DR
Each benchmark is a self-contained task that triggers a full generation–evaluation–reflection–optimization loop in GEAK. The benchmarks don’t get modified — they define the target, validate the output, and provide the performance ground truth the pipeline iterates against.

You said:
Where does ROCm Triton benchmark fit into it
ChatGPT said:
The ROCm Triton Benchmark isn’t a separate stage in the GEAK pipeline — it functions exactly like TritonBench-revised but is used as a second evaluation track. Here’s how it fits in:

✅ 1. It’s an Input Source — Just Like TritonBench-revised
GEAK pulls tasks from two pools:

Pool A: TritonBench-revised (184 synthetic/adapted kernels)
Pool B: ROCm Triton Benchmark (30 real-world kernels from AMD repos)

Each task from either pool enters the same agent loop:
Generation → Evaluation → Reflection → Optimization

✅ 2. Why Have a Separate ROCm Suite?
It gives GEAK a more realistic stress test:

TritonBench-revised	ROCm Triton Benchmark
184 kernels	30 kernels
Synthetic / adapted	Real-world, production code
Generic patterns	Real ML / HPC ops
Controlled tests	Practical constraints
So the pipeline doesn’t change — the workload changes.

✅ 3. Same Pipeline, Different Goals
When a task comes specifically from the ROCm suite, the pipeline uses it to assess:

✅ Real-world correctness
Does GEAK produce kernels that survive real input patterns, dtypes, and dimensions used in AMD repositories?

✅ Practical performance
Does its output match or beat existing ROCm Triton kernels?

✅ Portability & generalization
Does GEAK work when the task isn’t a cleaned-up synthetic benchmark?

✅ 4. Where It “Fits”
If you imagine the full workflow, it looks like this:

  ┌─────────────────────────────┐
  │ Benchmark Source Selection  │
  │  ├─ TritonBench-revised     │  ← 184 tasks
  │  └─ ROCm Triton Benchmark   │  ← 30 tasks
  └─────────────────────────────┘
                 ↓
  Generation → Evaluation → Reflection → Optimization
                 ↓
           Results Logged
There’s no branch, no separate pipeline — just two feeding datasets that test GEAK under different conditions.

✅ TL;DR
The ROCm Triton Benchmark is not a new stage — it’s a second benchmark suite that feeds into the exact same GEAK pipeline, used to measure performance and correctness on real-world AMD kernels rather than synthetic or adapted ones.

Summarize this

Benchmarks As program synthesis research advances, the need for rigorous and multidimensional benchmarks has
become increasingly important. Most existing coding benchmarks concentrate on functional correctness, often assessed
through manually crafted test cases and isolated execution environments. For instance, HumanEval provides expertwritten programming tasks paired with curated test suites, while MBPP[2] collects problems through crowdsourcing.
2
To improve coverage and scalability, more recent approaches have turned to automated test generation[3], enabling
broader application in areas such as software engineering and developer assistance[4].
In addition to correctness, performance profiling is gaining traction as a crucial axis in benchmarking ([5];[3];[6];[7]).
However, most existing frameworks emphasize competition-style tasks or sequential execution and provide limited
support for parallel or hardware-specific evaluation. While a few benchmarks address parallel CPU programming
([8];[9]), GPU-targeted benchmarks remain scarce, despite the growing importance of hardware efficiency in deploying
large-scale deep learning models.
To address this gap, benchmarks like KernelBench [10] and TritonBench [1] have emerged, offering domain-specific
assessments of LLM performance on GPU kernel generation. KernelBench [10] focuses on correctness and runtime
efficiency across diverse workloads using metrics like "fast_p", while TritonBench [1] highlights the challenges LLMs
face in generating performant code for the Triton DSL. These benchmarks reveal a substantial gap between generalpurpose code generation and the demands of high-performance, hardware-aware synthesis, underscoring the need for
specialized, compute-oriented evaluation frameworks.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a concise summary of your text:

Existing program synthesis benchmarks largely focus on functional correctness using curated or crowdsourced test cases (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP). Automated test generation has expanded coverage and scalability, but most benchmarks still emphasize sequential or CPU tasks, offering limited support for parallel or hardware-specific evaluation, especially on GPUs.

To address this, GPU-oriented benchmarks like KernelBench and TritonBench have emerged. They assess both correctness and performance of LLM-generated GPU kernels, highlighting the gap between general-purpose code generation and the demands of high-performance, hardware-aware synthesis, emphasizing the need for specialized, compute-focused benchmarking frameworks.

If you want, I can make an even shorter 1–2 sentence version for slide or paper use.

You said:
What does KernelBench and TritonBench lack that the GEAK paper offers to solve?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the key distinction:

1. Limitations of KernelBench and TritonBench
Limitation	Explanation
Static evaluation	Both benchmarks mainly measure correctness and performance of pre-existing kernels. They don’t generate kernels themselves.
Single-pass assessment	They provide metrics like runtime or correctness but don’t iteratively refine code or improve performance beyond the original kernel.
Limited task description use	Typically require full kernel implementations or detailed specs; they don’t start from minimal prompts.
No multi-agent optimization	They don’t incorporate AI-guided iterative feedback loops for improving kernel quality or efficiency.
Narrow compute scaling	Benchmarking is on fixed workloads; they don’t explore adaptive generation strategies using inference-time compute scaling.
2. What GEAK adds
Generative capability: Starts from minimal task descriptions and produces Triton GPU kernels automatically.

Iterative refinement: Uses a loop of generation → evaluation → reflection → optimization to improve both correctness and performance.

Multi-agent system: Different agents handle generation, evaluation, reflection, and optimization, enabling continuous feedback-driven improvement.

Performance-aware synthesis: Targets hardware-efficient kernels with optimization steps informed by real GPU benchmarks.

Adaptive compute scaling: Can leverage additional inference-time compute to refine kernels for better execution metrics.

TL;DR:
KernelBench and TritonBench measure existing kernels; GEAK generates, evaluates, and iteratively optimizes kernels from minimal prompts, closing the gap between code generation and high-performance, hardware-aware synthesis.

If you want, I can make a one-paragraph comparison that’s very concise for a paper or presentation. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
LLMs for Code Generation More recent work has explored the use of large language models for code generation,
but often in general-purpose contexts with limited success on performance-critical low level code, such as DeepSeekCoder[11] and Qwen-Coder[12], which have achieved strong performance on broad coding benchmarks.
There are also LLMs specifically trained for the kernel generation task, such as KernelLLM. However, its capability is
limited to translating PyTorch code into Triton kernels, restricting its general applicability. In contrast, our agent can
generate Triton code based on both natural language instructions and reference code, allowing for more flexible and
context-aware code synthesis. Furthermore, specialized models like KernelLLM often lack the broader reasoning and
problem-solving capabilities exhibited by larger state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4.1 and Claude 4, which are critical
for tackling complex optimization tasks involving multiple constraints and trade-offs.

Does this imply GEAK is model independent?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — that passage strongly implies that GEAK is model-independent, at least in principle. Here’s why:

1. Key clues from the text
GEAK “can generate Triton code based on both natural language instructions and reference code.”
→ It doesn’t rely on a single pre-trained kernel-specific model like KernelLLM.

It contrasts itself with specialized models that “often lack broader reasoning,” implying that GEAK leverages the reasoning abilities of any capable LLM.

The multi-agent framework (generation, evaluation, reflection, optimization) is modular, meaning different LLMs can be swapped in as the generation or reasoning engine.

2. Implications
You could use GPT-4.1, Claude 4, or other capable LLMs as the backbone.

The performance and reasoning quality might vary depending on the model, but the pipeline itself doesn’t require a specific LLM.

GEAK is more about the framework and iterative loop than about a single pre-trained kernel model.

✅ TL;DR
GEAK is model-agnostic: it can work with different LLMs as long as they can generate code and understand instructions, unlike specialized models like KernelLLM that are tied to specific source-to-target mappings.

If you want, I can draw a diagram showing how GEAK’s multi-agent loop can plug in any LLM, which makes the model-independence very clear. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Inference-Time Compute Scaling Inference-time compute scaling refers to the strategy of allocating increased
computational resources—such as longer context windows, multiple reasoning passes, or parallel generations — during
the inference phase of machine learning models to boost performance on complex tasks. Notably, this approach
enables significant improvements in large language model (LLM) performance without requiring additional training.
For example, the Chain-of-Thought [13] prompting technique enhances reasoning by encouraging models to answer
questions in a step-by-step manner. Similarly, the Reflexion [13] framework improves agent performance by integrating
verbalized feedback into an episodic memory buffer, which guides more informed decision-making in future attempts.
Our proposed GEAK agent also leverages inference-time compute scaling to improve code generation and optimization
quality. In addition, we incorporate a Reflexion-style module for debugging, enabling the agent to iteratively refine its
outputs based on past execution feedback.

How does this fit into the larger picture?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s how Inference-Time Compute Scaling fits into the larger GEAK framework and its overall goals:

1. What it does in GEAK
GEAK allocates extra compute during inference to improve the quality of kernel generation.

This can include:

Longer reasoning chains (thinking through the problem step by step)

Multiple generation passes (trying several kernel drafts)

Parallel explorations (simultaneously evaluating multiple candidate kernels)

This means GEAK doesn’t rely on retraining models — it uses existing LLMs more effectively at runtime.

2. How it interacts with GEAK agents
Generation Agent: Can produce multiple candidates using extra inference compute.

Evaluation & Reflection Agents: Can leverage previous failures or performance metrics to guide the next generation round (a Reflexion-style feedback loop).

Optimization Agent: Uses compute-intensive reasoning to suggest performance tweaks or kernel improvements.

3. Why it matters
Improves correctness: More reasoning passes reduce errors in kernel generation.

Enhances performance: By generating multiple candidates and iteratively refining them, GEAK can select the most efficient kernel.

Enables adaptive exploration: Complex optimization trade-offs (memory tiling, block sizes, fusion) can be reasoned about without retraining the LLM.

4. Bigger picture
GEAK isn’t just “generate a kernel once and stop.” With inference-time compute scaling:

It expands the effective reasoning capability of the LLM during generation.

It integrates feedback from execution tests (via Reflection/Reflexion modules).

It iteratively produces better, hardware-efficient Triton kernels.

Think of it as giving the LLM more “brain cycles” on-demand during each task, allowing GEAK to bridge the gap between general code generation and high-performance, hardware-aware synthesis.

If you want, I can make a single diagram showing how compute scaling + multi-agent loop + Reflexion feedback all fit together in GEAK, which really makes the whole picture click. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
GEAK allocates extra compute during inference to improve the quality of kernel generation

Does "allocate extra compute" just mean more multiple models/passes, larger models, and larger context input?
ChatGPT said:
Exactly — in the context of GEAK, “allocate extra compute” primarily refers to increasing the computational resources used during inference, without retraining. Concretely, this can mean:

1. Multiple passes / generations
Generating several candidate kernels for the same task.

Each candidate can be evaluated and refined iteratively.

Essentially giving the LLM “more attempts” to find a better solution.

2. Longer reasoning chains / larger context
Using longer context windows so the model can consider more information (task description, reference code, past execution feedback).

Enables step-by-step reasoning or multi-step problem solving (like Chain-of-Thought).

3. Larger or more capable models
Using a bigger LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1 instead of a smaller model) increases reasoning capacity and output quality.

Can be combined with multiple passes to further improve kernel quality.

4. Parallel explorations
Running multiple inference threads or agents in parallel.

Each explores a different variant of the kernel, then the evaluation agent picks the best.

✅ Key point: This is all during inference, not retraining. GEAK just uses the LLM more intensively to improve correctness and performance of the generated kernels.

If you want, I can make a short formula or diagram showing how GEAK balances number of passes, context length, and model size to “scale compute at inference”. It makes this idea very visual. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
1- shot prompting To enable 1-shot prompting, the most similar Triton code from existing datasets is used in the
prompt. The datasets used for 1-shot prompt do not overlap with the benchmark. We observed that 1-shot sample
retrieval from datasets is most effective with code similarity rather than instruction similarity.

what do they use to determine similarity?
ChatGPT said:
From what you’ve shared, GEAK uses code similarity—not instruction similarity—to select the 1-shot example. While the text doesn’t explicitly specify the method, in practice this usually involves:

1. Embedding-based similarity
Represent each candidate code snippet as a vector embedding using a code-aware model (like OpenAI’s code-embedding models, CodeBERT, or similar).

Compare embeddings of the new task and candidate snippets using cosine similarity.

Select the snippet with the highest similarity score as the 1-shot example.

2. Syntactic or token-based similarity
Compare sequences of tokens or AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structures.

Measures structural resemblance between code snippets.

Less flexible than embeddings but still used in some kernel generation pipelines.

3. Why code similarity over instruction similarity
Instructions (natural language prompts) may be vague, inconsistent, or too high-level.

Code similarity ensures the 1-shot snippet is structurally and semantically close to the target kernel.

This improves the model’s ability to generalize patterns, memory layouts, and Triton-specific constructs.

✅ TL;DR: GEAK retrieves 1-shot examples based on code similarity, likely using embedding-based or structural comparison, because it gives better guidance to the LLM than comparing textual instructions.

If you want, I can sketch how the 1-shot retrieval works in the GEAK pipeline, showing code embeddings, similarity scoring, and prompt injection. Do you want me to do that?

Reflexion: Language agents with verbal reinforcement learning, 2023.

Summarize this paper in 4 sentences
ChatGPT said:
The paper "Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning" introduces a novel framework where language agents enhance their performance not by adjusting model weights, but through verbal feedback. This feedback is stored in an episodic memory buffer, allowing the agent to reflect on past actions and improve future decision-making. The Reflexion approach has shown significant improvements in various tasks, including coding and language reasoning. For instance, Reflexion achieved a 91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art GPT-4's 80% 
arXiv
.

Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods that require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning, Reflexion leverages linguistic feedback to reinforce language agents. This method is flexible enough to incorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources (external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, leading to improved performance across diverse tasks 
OpenReview
.

In summary, Reflexion offers a framework where language agents can learn from their experiences through verbal reflection, enhancing their decision-making capabilities without the need for model retraining.

You said:
how/when do they recall the reflexion?
ChatGPT said:
In the Reflexion framework, the agent recalls past reflections at decision points during task execution, typically before generating its next action or output. Here’s the breakdown:

1. Storage of reflections
After each attempt at a task, the agent generates verbal feedback describing what went wrong, why, or what could be improved.

These reflections are stored in an episodic memory buffer along with the context of the attempt (inputs, outputs, errors, success metrics).

2. When recall happens
Before starting a new attempt on the same or similar task, the agent retrieves relevant reflections from memory.

Relevance is usually determined via similarity matching (e.g., embedding similarity between current task and past attempts).

3. How recall is used
Reflections are incorporated into the prompt for the LLM or into the agent’s reasoning context.

The agent can then adjust its strategy, avoid past mistakes, or explore better solutions.

This is a pre-generation step: the LLM “reflects” on previous experiences before generating the next output, not during the original execution.

4. Effect
This iterative cycle allows the agent to improve over multiple attempts without retraining the model, essentially learning via verbal reinforcement.

✅ TL;DR: The agent recalls Reflexion before generating its next action, using past verbal feedback stored in memory to guide reasoning and avoid repeating mistakes.

If you want, I can explain how GEAK incorporates a Reflexion-style loop specifically for kernel generation and optimization — it’s very similar but hardware-focused. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Which part of the reflection is embedded? The task, what went wrong, or what should be improved?
ChatGPT said:
In the Reflexion framework, typically all of the key components of a reflection are embedded together, but the primary focus is on what will help the agent retrieve relevant past experiences for future reasoning. Specifically:

1. What is embedded
Task context / input: The problem the agent was trying to solve.

What went wrong: The agent’s verbalized analysis of its errors or failures.

Suggested improvements / next steps: Guidance or corrective actions for future attempts.

These elements are usually concatenated into a single textual reflection and then passed through an embedding model (e.g., a code- or text-aware LLM embedding).

2. Why embed the full reflection
Embedding the task + errors + suggested improvements allows the retrieval system to match current tasks to past experiences effectively.

If only the task were embedded, the agent might miss important lessons from prior failures.

If only the errors or suggestions were embedded, the retrieval might select irrelevant reflections.

3. How it’s used
The current task is also embedded.

Similarity search is performed between the current task embedding and all stored reflection embeddings.

Top matches are retrieved and included in the LLM prompt as guidance for the next attempt.

✅ TL;DR: The Reflexion embedding typically includes task context, what went wrong, and suggested improvements, so that the agent can recall the most relevant past experiences to guide future reasoning.

I can also make a diagram showing how a reflection is stored, embedded, and recalled if you want—it makes this process very clear. Do you want me to do that?

language models as optimizers, 2024.
ChatGPT said:
The paper "Large Language Models as Optimizers" introduces Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers for tasks traditionally requiring gradient-based methods.

🔍 What is OPRO?
OPRO utilizes LLMs to iteratively generate and refine solutions to optimization problems by incorporating previous solutions and their evaluations into the prompt. This method is particularly effective for derivative-free optimization tasks, where traditional gradient information is unavailable.

🧠 How Does It Work?
Initial Prompt: The process begins with a prompt that describes the optimization problem.

Solution Generation: The LLM generates a candidate solution based on the prompt.

Evaluation: The generated solution is evaluated, and its performance is quantified.

Prompt Augmentation: The prompt is updated to include the new solution and its evaluation.

Iteration: Steps 2–4 are repeated, with the LLM generating new solutions informed by the augmented prompt, leading to progressively improved solutions.

📈 Applications and Results
OPRO has been demonstrated to effectively solve various optimization problems, including:

Linear Regression: Finding the best-fitting line for a set of data points.

Traveling Salesman Problem: Determining the shortest possible route visiting a set of cities.

Prompt Optimization: Enhancing the performance of LLMs on tasks like GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard by optimizing the prompts used to query them.

In prompt optimization tasks, OPRO outperformed human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K and up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

temperature set to 1

ChatGPT said:
Setting temperature = 1 means the model generates outputs with moderate creativity and diversity, balancing randomness and coherence.

You said:
What does temperature 0 mean respond in one sentence
ChatGPT said:
A temperature of 0 makes the model deterministic, always choosing the most likely next token and producing less creative, highly predictable outputs.

You said:
Can temp be higher than 1?
ChatGPT said:
Yes — setting temperature higher than 1 increases randomness, making the model more creative and diverse but also more prone to producing errors or incoherent outputs.

You said:
Summarize what they did:

We first establish our baseline by directly prompting frontier LLMs, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude
3.7 Sonnet, to produce the kernels. As shown in Table2, across all models, direct prompting yields low execution accuracy and suboptimal performance, indicating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to produce correct and 
efficient low-level code without further guidance.
Introducing one-shot prompting—where a single example retrieved from TritonBench trainset is provided—consistently
improves both call accuracy and execution accuracy compared to zero-shot prompting. In most cases, one-shot
prompting also leads to higher speedup, suggesting that the additional context helps LLMs generate more efficient
kernels. However, a notable exception is observed with Gemini 2.5 Pro, where one-shot prompting results in lower
speedup than direct prompting, despite improvements in accuracy.
Table2 shows the direct prompting results on the ROCm benchmark. Direct prompting with GPT-4.1 fails to generate
any valid kernels, underscoring the challenge of targeting non-CUDA platforms. In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves
better results than GPT-4.1 on both the TritonBench-revised and ROCm benchmarks, though the overall performance
remains limited.
As shown in Table3 and Table4, compared to direct LLM prompting, our system GEAK delivers significantly stronger
results. On MI300, GEAK achieves 54.89% execution accuracy and a 2.59× speedup on TritonBench-revised Benchmark, and 63.33% execution accuracy and 0.92x speedup on ROCm Benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our agent framework. We also present a case study in Appendix A on triton_test_flip.py kernel analyzing potential
strategies for performance gain

Here’s a concise summary of what they did:

They first established a baseline by directly prompting frontier LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) to generate Triton kernels, which resulted in low execution accuracy and poor performance, showing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with low-level, hardware-efficient code.

They then applied one-shot prompting, providing a single relevant example from the TritonBench training set, which improved both correctness and execution efficiency for most models, though Gemini 2.5 Pro saw higher accuracy but lower speedup in some cases.

Direct prompting on the ROCm benchmark highlighted platform-specific challenges, with GPT-4.1 failing entirely, while Gemini 2.5 Pro performed slightly better but still limited.

Finally, using their GEAK system, which employs a multi-agent iterative framework, they achieved substantially higher execution accuracy and speedups across both benchmarks (e.g., 54.89% accuracy and 2.59× speedup on TritonBench-revised), demonstrating the effectiveness of their generation–evaluation–reflection–optimization loop.

## Related Works

### Benchmarks

There are existing program synthesis benchmarks that focus on correctness using curated or crowd sourced test cases. 

There have been efforts to put automated LLM test generation for expanded coverage and scalability but these typically focus on sequential or CPU tasks.

GPU-Oriented benchmarks, such as TritonBench or KernelBench, focus on both correctness AND performance of existing GPU kernels.

None of these examples offer minimal short tasks for LLM generated kernels. Thats where this new benchmark suite fills in.

### LLMs for Code generation

KernelLLM: PyTorch -> Triton code
- Trained LLM
- NOT a reasoning model
- Only trained for PyTorch to Triton

GEAK: Natural Language AND Reference Code -> Triton code
- LLM agnostic as it is an agentic framework

- Evaluation & Reflection Agents: Leverages previous failures or performance metrics to guide the next generation round (a Reflexion-style feedback loop)

- Optimization Agent: Uses compute-intensive reasoning to suggest performance tweaks or kernel improvements

### Modules

1-shot prompting: Pull most similar triton code from dataset. Unclear how they did this, possibly code-embeddings or AST?

Knowledge Injection: Enhance prompt with domain specific efficient triton kernel including hardware specs 

Reflexion: When an agent fails, store "reflection" in memory buffer that they recall for future tasks 

LLM selection for kernel agent: Underling LLM significantly impacts performance

LLM as Optimizer: Iteratively generate and refine solutions to optimize problems by generating candidates which are evaluated and included in next prompt

Debugging trap: Impose limit on number of debug attempts so doesnt infinite loop

Parallel Scaling: Run GEAK indepently in parallel to introduce diversity helping yield correct and faster kernels

## Experiment

### Naive approach

Direct zeroshot prompting LLMs to generate kernels:
- Very poor results
- Even SOTA LLMs struggled

Oneshot prompt LLMs to generate kernels:
- Gave a single relevant example
- Slightly better in overall accuracy and performance
- Gemini 2.5 Pro saw higher accuracy but lower speedup than direct prompting in some examples

Overall clear platform-specific challenges for naive approaches

### GEAK

Had significant correctness and performance gains relative to the other methods

Your notes are already very thorough and cover most of the important aspects of the GEAK paper, but there are a few additional points and nuances you might want to include to make your summary even more complete:

1. Inference-Time Compute Scaling
You mention multi-pass generation and parallel scaling, but explicitly noting that GEAK leverages longer reasoning chains, multiple candidate generations, and larger context windows as part of inference-time compute scaling could clarify how the LLM’s reasoning capacity is effectively increased without retraining.

2. Reflexion-style Memory Details
You noted that reflections are stored and recalled, but it’s worth specifying that the stored reflections include the task context, what went wrong, and suggested improvements, which are embedded for retrieval based on similarity.

This allows the agent to iteratively refine future kernel generations based on past failures.

3. Temperature for Diversity
GEAK uses temperature = 1 for moderate diversity in candidate kernels and parallel runs to explore the search space.

Could note that higher temperature increases randomness/creativity and temperature = 0 produces deterministic outputs.

4. Evaluation Metrics
You listed call accuracy, eval accuracy, and speedup — you might also note that GEAK tracks number of iterations required to reach a correct kernel, which is part of measuring efficiency of the iterative loop.

5. Benchmark Novelty
GEAK’s benchmark isn’t just TritonBench-revised and ROCm — the key novelty is providing minimal task descriptions suitable for LLM generation, which is missing in previous GPU-oriented benchmarks.

6. LLM Selection
You mention underlying LLM impacts performance — could add that GEAK is LLM-agnostic, but the final results depend on the reasoning capability and domain knowledge of the chosen LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro).

7. Platform-Specific Observations
In experiments, GPT-4.1 failed entirely on ROCm kernels, highlighting cross-platform challenges, which is worth emphasizing.

8. Debugging / Iteration Control
You note a limit on debug attempts — you might explicitly add that this prevents infinite loops in iterative refinement, keeping the agent practical.

Optional Additions (if you want more detail)
Case studies: The paper includes examples like triton_test_flip.py to illustrate how GEAK refines kernels for performance.

Comparison to specialized models: KernelLLM is constrained to PyTorch→Triton; GEAK works from NL instructions or reference code, showing broader generality.

✅ Summary: Your notes are excellent; adding explicit details on inference-time compute scaling, what’s embedded in Reflexion, temperature usage, iteration tracking, and the minimal-task benchmark novelty would make it more complete.

If you want, I can create a single-page condensed summary that combines all of this into a structured overview for reference. Do you want me to do that?

Here’s a single-page, structured summary of GEAK incorporating all your notes plus the missing key points:

GEAK: Generating Efficient AI-Centric Triton GPU Kernels
Innovations
Evaluation Suite

TritonBench-revised: 184 kernels adapted from TritonBench-G with minimal task descriptions and correctness harnesses.

ROCm Triton Benchmark: 30 real-world kernels from AMD ROCm repositories, converted to Triton-compatible tasks.

Key novelty: Benchmarks designed for LLM-generated kernels from minimal prompts, unlike prior GPU benchmarks.

GEAK Framework

Agentic LLM system for generation, evaluation, reflection, and optimization of Triton kernels.

Iterative refinement pre-runtime, not during execution.

Model-agnostic: can use any capable LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro).

Pipeline & Agents
Agent	Role
Generation	Produces multiple candidate kernels using extra inference-time compute: multi-pass, longer context, parallel exploration, optional larger LLMs.
Evaluation	Checks call accuracy (compilation) and execution accuracy (unit tests) and measures performance (speedup).
Reflection	Stores failed attempts and analysis in memory: task, errors, suggested improvements, embedded for similarity-based recall in future generations.
Optimization	Suggests performance improvements (e.g., block sizes, tiling) using compute-intensive reasoning.
Additional Modules
1-shot prompting: Retrieves most similar code from dataset (likely via code embeddings or AST similarity) to provide context.

Knowledge Injection: Adds domain-specific kernel examples and hardware specs to prompts.

Reflexion-style loop: Enables iterative improvement without retraining.

Parallel scaling: Runs multiple independent agents to increase diversity and chance of better kernels.

Debugging limit: Prevents infinite loops in iterative refinement.

Temperature: 1 → moderate diversity; 0 → deterministic; >1 → more creative/random outputs.

LLM Considerations
LLM choice impacts quality: reasoning capability, domain knowledge, and context handling matter.

Unlike KernelLLM (PyTorch→Triton), GEAK handles natural language instructions or reference code.

Evaluation Metrics
Call accuracy: % of kernels that compile.

Execution accuracy: % passing all unit tests.

Speedup: Performance relative to baseline.

Iteration efficiency: # of refinement loops to reach correct kernel.

Experiments
Naive LLM prompting
Zero-shot: Low correctness and performance across GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7.

One-shot: Slight improvements using a single relevant example; some exceptions (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro saw lower speedup despite higher accuracy).

Platform-specific challenges: GPT-4.1 failed on ROCm kernels; Gemini 2.5 Pro performed better but still limited.

GEAK
Significant gains in correctness and speedup across benchmarks.

TritonBench-revised (MI300): 54.89% execution accuracy, 2.59× speedup.

ROCm benchmark: 63.33% execution accuracy, 0.92× speedup.

Demonstrated effectiveness of multi-agent iterative refinement and hardware-aware code synthesis.

Key Takeaways
GEAK addresses the gap between general-purpose LLM code generation and high-performance, hardware-aware kernel synthesis.

Combines model-agnostic agentic framework, inference-time compute scaling, 1-shot code retrieval, and Reflexion-style memory to generate correct and efficient GPU kernels from minimal prompts.

Evaluation suite provides rigorous, minimal-task benchmarks for both synthetic and real-world GPU kernels.

If you want, I can also make a diagram of the GEAK multi-agent pipeline with inference-time compute and Reflexion feedback that visually summarizes the entire system — it’s often very helpful for presentations. Do you want me to do that?
