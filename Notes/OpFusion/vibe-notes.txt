What is XLA
ChatGPT said:
XLA stands for Accelerated Linear Algebra. It’s a compiler originally developed by Google to speed up numerical computations—especially those used in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch/XLA.

Here’s what it does in simple terms:

Optimizes math-heavy code (like matrix multiplications, convolutions, etc.).

Fuses operations together so they run more efficiently on hardware.

Targets multiple backends: CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

Reduces memory usage and execution time by compiling graphs ahead of time instead of running them operation by operation.

If you're using TensorFlow with jit_compile=True, or using JAX (where most things are JIT-compiled by default), you’re already benefiting from XLA under the hood.

If you meant a different context for "XLA," just say so and I’ll adjust!

You said:
How does it work?
ChatGPT said:
XLA works by taking high-level tensor operations (like “multiply these matrices” or “apply this activation function”) and turning them into a highly optimized, hardware-specific computation. Here’s the process broken down:

✅ 1. It intercepts your computation graph
Frameworks like TensorFlow or JAX build a graph of tensor operations. Instead of running each op one at a time in Python, XLA grabs the whole graph (or portions of it) to optimize.

Example:

z = relu(x @ y + b)
Normally that might run as three kernel calls:

Matrix multiply

Add bias

ReLU

✅ 2. It converts the graph into HLO (High-Level Optimizer) IR
XLA converts the operations into its own intermediate representation called HLO, which makes it easier to analyze and transform.

✅ 3. It performs optimizations
Some of the key ones:

Operation fusion → combines ops to avoid extra memory reads/writes
(e.g., matmul + bias + relu becomes one kernel)

Constant folding → precomputes parts that don’t change

Dead code elimination → removes unused operations

Layout optimization → rearranges tensor memory layouts for speed

Buffer reuse & aliasing → reduces memory allocations

✅ 4. It compiles to machine code for the target hardware
Depending on the device, XLA emits different low-level code:

CPU → LLVM → native CPU instructions

GPU → PTX (NVIDIA) or HIP (AMD)

TPU → TPU-specific ops

So instead of dispatching many small kernels, you get a few large, highly efficient ones.

✅ 5. It runs the compiled executable
The optimized program is executed with the tensors you supply. Many frameworks also cache compiled programs so repeated calls run instantly.

✅ Benefits you get:
🚀 Much faster execution (especially for large or repeated workloads)

🔋 Lower memory usage

📦 Fewer kernel launches

🔁 Can batch dynamic shapes if supported

⚙️ Works with TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch/XLA

If you’re curious how it plays out in a specific framework (JAX? PyTorch? TF?), I can walk you through that too.

You said:
Does this work in Eager mode?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — the answer depends on the framework:

✅ TensorFlow
By default, XLA does not optimize regular eager-mode execution. Eager mode runs ops one at a time immediately, which prevents XLA from seeing and optimizing a larger computation graph.

However, you can still use XLA in eager mode by wrapping functions:

✅ Option 1: @tf.function(jit_compile=True)
@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
def my_fn(x, y, b):
    return tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(x, y) + b)

out = my_fn(x, y, b)
Even if you're in eager mode, the decorated function is staged and compiled with XLA.

✅ Option 2: tf.xla.experimental.compile(...) (older API)
out = tf.xla.experimental.compile(lambda: tf.matmul(x, y))
Raw eager ops like:

z = tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(x, y) + b)
won’t go through XLA unless wrapped.

✅ JAX
JAX is “eager” only on the surface — under the hood almost everything is staged and JIT-compiled with XLA. So you get XLA by default unless you avoid jit or use jax.disable_jit().

✅ PyTorch/XLA
PyTorch eager mode does not use XLA. You need to run with the XLA backend (e.g., TPU or GPU via torch_xla) for XLA to kick in.

Example:

import torch_xla.core.xla_model as xm
device = xm.xla_device()
tensor = torch.randn(10, 10, device=device)
🧠 Summary
Framework	Eager Mode + XLA by default?	How to enable XLA
TensorFlow	❌ No	@tf.function(jit_compile=True)
JAX	✅ Yes (via jit)	Already enabled
PyTorch	❌ No	Use PyTorch/XLA device
If you’re using TensorFlow and want XLA with eager-style code, wrapping functions is the way to go. Let me know your framework and I can show a specific example!

What is the difference between Operator Fusion in XLA vs other existing technologies such as Ansor, Torchscript, TVM Auto Scheduler etc.
ChatGPT said:
Here's a high-level comparison of how XLA’s operator fusion differs from fusion strategies in systems like TVM (AutoScheduler/Ansor) and TorchScript — both in method and intent.

✅ 1. How Fusion is Triggered
🔹 XLA
Fusion is graph-level and compiler-driven.

Uses its intermediate representation (HLO) to analyze the entire computation graph.

Fusion happens automatically during compilation passes — no tuning or search.

🔹 TVM (Ansor / AutoScheduler)
Fusion is part of a search-based optimization process.

Operators are rewritten via schedule transformations.

The system explores different fusion (and non-fusion) variants, benchmarking them on hardware.

Requires a cost model, profiling, or tuning time.

🔹 TorchScript
Fusion is backend-driven and often tied to specific fusers like:

nvFuser (CUDA)

NNC/TorchInductor

Fusion patterns are recognized via pattern matching on the IR.

Limited to predefined op types, often elementwise + reductions.

✅ 2. Fusion Granularity
🔹 XLA
Can fuse:

Elementwise ops

Reductions

Broadcasts

Some contractions (GEMM)

Fusion groups become single kernels with no intermediate memory writes.

TPUs: fusion is essential for lowering to hardware primitives.

🔹 TVM
Fuses ops only when legal within scheduling rules.

Often limited by tensor layout constraints.

Fusion scope decided as part of search space.

🔹 TorchScript
Fusion is pattern-based — common cases include:

add → relu

mul → add → sigmoid

Fusion is typically local, not whole-graph.

✅ 3. Compilation vs Code Generation
🔹 XLA
Fusion results in a single custom kernel generated from fused HLO.

No fallback to separate kernels unless fusion is impossible.

🔹 TVM / Ansor
Generates multiple schedules, measures them, and picks one.

Fusion interacts with tiling, vectorization, memory layout, etc.

🔹 TorchScript
Fusion may hand off to a JIT backend that emits CUDA/C++ code.

Some fallback to ATen kernels when unsupported.

✅ 4. Strategy: Static vs Dynamic
Aspect	XLA	TVM (Ansor)	TorchScript
Fusion approach	Compiler pass	Auto-tuning search space	Pattern-based
Requires tuning?	❌ No	✅ Yes	❌ No
Scope	Graph-level	Op/subgraph-level	Local subgraphs
Hardware targeting	TPU, GPU, CPU	Broad	Primarily GPU/CPU
✅ 5. When Fusion Happens
XLA: At compile time, before lowering to machine code

TVM/Ansor: As part of schedule generation & measurement

TorchScript: During IR lowering/JIT ahead-of-time or at runtime

✅ 6. Optimization Objective
🔹 XLA
Minimize memory operations and kernel launches

Designed around static shapes and graph compilation

🔹 TVM/Ansor
Optimize end-to-end schedule performance

May choose not to fuse if scheduling cost is higher

🔹 TorchScript
Practical fusion of Python-level ops for GPU/CPU

Often focused on elementwise chains

✅ TL;DR
XLA fuses aggressively and deterministically at the compiler graph level, turning fused ops into a single kernel without runtime tuning.

Ansor/TVM treat fusion as a search-and-cost problem, balancing fusion with scheduling constraints.

TorchScript relies on pattern-based fusion with limited scope and backend-specific implementations.

If you want, I can compare XLA specifically to one of them in more depth — just name which one.

You said:
Is XLA different than Operator fusion in XLA?
ChatGPT said:
They’re not two separate things — operator fusion is just one optimization inside XLA, not something different from it.

Here’s how to think about it:

✅ XLA = the full compiler
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is the whole system that:

Lowers graphs to HLO IR

Runs many optimization passes

Does layout planning and buffer reuse

Fuses ops when beneficial

Lowers to machine code (CPU/GPU/TPU)

It's the full compilation pipeline.

✅ Operator Fusion in XLA = just one feature of that compiler
Operator fusion is one optimization pass XLA applies to reduce:

Kernel launches

Intermediate memory writes

Latency and bandwidth use

Example:

z = relu(x @ y + b)
Naive execution → 3 kernels
XLA fusion → 1 fused kernel

But XLA does much more than fusion (constant folding, DCE, algebraic simplification, inlining, etc.).

✅ Analogy
Think of it like:

XLA = the kitchen

Operator fusion = one cooking technique used in that kitchen

So asking “Is XLA different than operator fusion in XLA?” is like asking “Is a compiler different from one of its optimizations?” — yes, because one is the whole system and the other is just a component inside it.

If you're trying to compare XLA fusion vs. fusion techniques in other compilers, happy to go deeper!

You said:
horizontal vs vertical operation fusion
ChatGPT said:
Here’s the distinction in a clear, practical way — vertical fusion vs horizontal fusion applies to how multiple operators are combined into a single fused kernel.

✅ 1. Vertical Fusion
This is producer → consumer fusion along the computation chain.

Example:
A = matmul(x, y)
B = add(A, b)
C = relu(B)
Instead of three kernels, you fuse them top-to-bottom into one:

C = relu(add(matmul(x, y), b))
✅ Reduces intermediate memory writes
✅ Eliminates kernel launch overhead
✅ Common in XLA, TensorRT, TVM, etc.

Think of it as fusing sequential ops in a stack.

✅ 2. Horizontal Fusion
This fuses sibling operations that run in parallel and have the same input shape or structure.

Example:
y1 = relu(x)
y2 = sigmoid(x)
Instead of launching two separate kernels:

Kernel 1: ReLU(x)

Kernel 2: Sigmoid(x)

You create one kernel that performs both in parallel on the same input.

✅ Better GPU utilization
✅ Eliminates duplicate reads of the same tensor
✅ Useful when the ops don’t depend on each other

Some compilers (like XLA and TVM) apply this in elementwise chains or branching graphs.

✅ ✅ Summary Table
Aspect	Vertical Fusion	Horizontal Fusion
Relation	Producer → Consumer	Parallel / Sibling ops
Graph structure	Linear chain	Same inputs / branch outputs
Goal	Remove intermediates	Combine similar parallel ops
Example	matmul → add → relu	relu(x) and sigmoid(x)
Memory savings	✅ Yes	✅ Sometimes
GPU efficiency	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Kernel count	Reduced by chaining	Reduced by batching
If you want examples from a specific system (XLA, TVM, PyTorch, TensorRT), just say which and I’ll tailor it!

You said:
XLA does a
reverse post-order traversal in this step to determine whether
two dependent operations should be fused or not via a
ShouldFuse function

why should this be done in reverse post order?
ChatGPT said:
Great question — the choice of reverse post-order traversal in XLA’s fusion pass isn’t arbitrary. It directly affects correctness, dependency handling, and the ability to build larger fused kernels efficiently.

Here’s why reverse post-order makes sense:

✅ 1. It processes consumers before producers
Reverse post-order means XLA walks the computation graph from the “outputs” backward toward the inputs.

That matters because fusion is often vertical (i.e., consumer → producer). To decide whether an op should fuse with its input, you need to know:

Is the consumer already fused?

Is there only one consumer?

Will fusing violate layout or cost constraints?

If you visited producers first (normal post-order), you wouldn't have context to make a good decision.

✅ 2. Enables bottom-up fusion grouping
Reverse post-order lets XLA build fusion "islands" starting from outputs and pulling in producers when profitable. This approach:

Avoids prematurely fusing producers that might feed into multiple consumers.

Ensures fusion doesn’t block better opportunities later in the traversal.

You're effectively growing fused computations outward from the output ops.

✅ 3. Avoids violating dependency order
Fusion requires that fusing two ops doesn’t break graph dependencies or reorder side effects. Reverse post-order ensures:

All relevant consumer ops are seen before examining producers.

No fusion decisions are made without knowing downstream usage.

It’s a safe traversal for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

✅ 4. Efficient traversal of HLO graphs
Most HLO modules are DAGs with single roots (e.g., model outputs). Reverse post-order ensures:

You don’t revisit nodes unnecessarily

Fusion checks happen in a topologically valid sequence

You can stop early when fusion is no longer possible

✅ 5. Matches the fusion heuristic logic (ShouldFuse)
The ShouldFuse(producer, consumer) function checks conditions like:

Are shapes/layouts compatible?

Will fusion reduce memory traffic?

Is the producer used only once?

Is the consumer already in a fusion node?

Reverse post-order guarantees the consumer state is known before this decision.

✅ In short:
Reverse post-order is used because fusion in XLA is driven by consumer needs, not producer availability. It ensures:

✔ Consumers are visited first
✔ Fusion grows in the right direction
✔ Dependency constraints are respected
✔ Fusion opportunities aren’t blocked prematurely

If you'd like, I can sketch a tiny example graph and show how traversal order changes which ops get fused!

You said:
Fusion Merger. This fusion pass attempts to merge fusion
instructions to reduce memory bandwidth requirements and
kernel launch overhead (Fig. 1(b)). Fusion instructions are
merged into their users if some conditions are met. For
example, the result of merging the fusion instruction into its
users would not increase bytes transferred; and if producer
operations are fusible with all consumers (if they are not
fusible with at least one consumer, they won’t be fused at
all).

this is a unique compiler pass? if so how is this different than instruction fusion?
ChatGPT said:
You're looking at two different stages of fusion in XLA, and the naming can be confusing if you haven’t seen the internals before. Here’s the key idea:

✅ Yes — Fusion Merger is a distinct compiler pass, and
✅ It’s different from the initial instruction fusion pass in both its goal and timing.

Let me break it down clearly.

✅ 1. Instruction Fusion (Initial Fusion Pass)
This is the first-level fusion that happens during HLO optimization. Its goal is to fuse individual producers into their consumers when profitable.

Examples:

Fuse add → relu

Fuse multiply → exp

Fuse elementwise ops into reduction kernels

Fuse small producers into GEMMs

This happens locally, one producer–consumer pair at a time, based on heuristics like:

Is producer used only once?

Will fusion reduce memory writes?

Are the shapes/layouts compatible?

This pass creates fusion instructions (a.k.a. “fusion nodes”), each containing multiple HLO ops.

✅ 2. Fusion Merger (Second-Level Fusion)
Once the first pass has created those fusion nodes, XLA runs another pass to see if those existing fusion instructions can be merged with each other.

✔ You're not fusing raw ops anymore — you're fusing fusion instructions into other fusion instructions.
This is where the quote you pasted comes in:

"Fusion instructions are merged into their users if some conditions are met..."

Examples of what Fusion Merger does:

Merge two fusion kernels if:

Their combined inputs/outputs don’t increase memory traffic

Their code can still be lowered as a single kernel

All consumers of the producer fusion allow it

Why do this?
Because initial fusion might produce fragmented fusion clusters. For example:

op1 → fusion_A → fusion_B → output
The initial pass might fuse op1 into fusion_A, and other ops into fusion_B. But only later does the compiler realize you could combine fusion_A and fusion_B into one kernel, reducing:

Kernel launches

Intermediate buffers

Memory bandwidth

That’s Fusion Merger — a later optimization that works on fusion nodes, not raw instructions.

✅ So how is Fusion Merger different from instruction fusion?
Feature	Instruction Fusion	Fusion Merger
Target	Raw ops (HLO instructions)	Previously fused instructions
Timing	Early in compilation	Later (post-fusion)
Scope	Local, producer → consumer	Larger, cross-fusion merging
Goal	Create initial fused kernels	Reduce # of fusion kernels further
Input	Individual ops	Fusion instructions
Strategy	Heuristic, pairwise	Graph-level merging with constraints
They work together:

Initial Fusion Pass → creates fusion nodes
Fusion Merger → combines those fusion nodes further
If you want, I can give you a visual before/after of what each pass does — just say the word!

You said:
Multi-Output Fusion. Multi-output fusion of sibling and
producer-consumer instructions for the GPU backend is also
intended to reduce memory bandwidth requirements. Typically, there are two types of multi-output fusion this pass
performs–sibling multi-output fusion (Fig. 1(c)) and producerconsumer multi-output fusion (Fig. 1(d)). Fusion of sibling operations can reduce memory bandwidth requirements, because
common input parameters have to be read only once. Fusion
of producer-consumer operations reduces memory bandwidth
requirements by eliminating one read from memory. Sibling
fusion and producer-consumer fusion can usually meet the
fusion constraints at the same time. XLA will select the
one that can give more fusion opportunities for later fusion
optimizations, and sibling has a higher priority over producerconsumer by default. These two types of multi-output fusion
can also be combined in this fusion pass.

explain this compiler pass
ChatGPT said:
You're looking at a specific fusion pass in XLA called Multi-Output Fusion, used mainly for GPU backends. It's separate from regular (single-output) fusion and happens after the first rounds of instruction fusion.

The purpose is simple:

✅ Generate ONE fused kernel that produces MULTIPLE outputs, instead of forcing one fusion per output.

That reduces:

Memory reads/writes

Temporary buffers

Kernel launch overhead

And increases:

Fusion opportunities in later stages

Reuse of shared inputs

Let’s break down the two kinds it performs.

✅ 1. Sibling Multi-Output Fusion
(“Parallel ops with shared inputs”)

This fuses multiple independent consumers that read from the same input.

Example:
y1 = relu(x)
y2 = sigmoid(x)
Without fusion → 2 kernels, each reads x separately.

With sibling multi-output fusion → 1 kernel:

fused(x) -> (relu(x), sigmoid(x))
🔹 Benefit: common input loaded once
🔹 Output: multiple result tensors from a single kernel
🔹 Priority: higher (preferred by XLA)

✅ 2. Producer-Consumer Multi-Output Fusion
This fuses a producer and its (single or few) consumers, but allows the fused kernel to produce multiple outputs.

Example:
t = exp(a)
y1 = t + b
y2 = t * c
Here t has two consumers. Instead of:

Generate t as its own kernel

Then launch two downstream kernels

XLA fuses them together:

fused(a, b, c) -> (exp(a) + b, exp(a) * c)
🔹 Benefit: eliminates writing/reading t from memory
🔹 Output: multiple tensors from one kernel

✅ 3. Why do this as a separate pass?
A standard fusion pass assumes one output per fusion node. But in many programs, that's artificial — you may have:

Shared inputs across ops (sibling case)

Shared producers used in multiple places (producer-consumer case)

So this pass:

Looks at fusion clusters already created

Identifies where multiple ops can share one fused kernel even with different outputs

Merges accordingly

✅ 4. How XLA Chooses What to Fuse
When both sibling and producer-consumer fusion are possible:

▶ Sibling fusion has higher priority, because:

It reduces redundant input reads

It keeps opportunities open for later fusion of producers

Then, producer-consumer fusion is considered.

Both types of fusion can be combined in a single fusion node when legal.

✅ 5. Why “multi-output” is special
Standard fusion builds kernels like:

f(x) -> out1
But multi-output fusion builds:

f(x) -> (out1, out2, out3)
This helps avoid:

One kernel per op

Intermediary writes

Shape or ownership conflicts

It’s especially helpful on GPUs, where kernel launch overhead and memory bandwidth are bottlenecks.

✅ In short
Multi-Output Fusion is a later fusion pass in XLA that creates fusion kernels with multiple outputs by merging:

1️⃣ Sibling ops (same inputs, independent outputs)
2️⃣ Producer-consumer chains where the producer feeds multiple consumers

Result:

Fewer kernels

Less memory IO

More fusion opportunities downstream

Better GPU efficiency

If you’d like an illustrated graph example, say the word!

You said:
- With one fused kernel, have multiple copies of the input and perform both functions in the kernel in parallel

is this an accurate explaination?
ChatGPT said:
You're very close, but there’s one detail that makes the explanation slightly incorrect:

❌ “have multiple copies of the input”
✅ Instead: read the input once and reuse it inside the fused kernel

Let me restate it accurately:

✅ What mult i-output (sibling) fusion actually does:
It emits one fused kernel

The input tensor is loaded once from memory

Inside the kernel, that same loaded value is used to compute multiple outputs (e.g., ReLU and sigmoid)

The work may be done in parallel across threads, but no redundant copies of the input are created

🔍 Why “multiple copies” is misleading
Saying “multiple copies of the input” implies:

Extra memory reads or tensors being duplicated

Wasted bandwidth

But the whole point of this fusion pass is to reduce memory bandwidth by:

Avoiding repeated loads of the same input

Avoiding storing intermediate tensors between kernels

Instead, the fused kernel typically looks like:

load x[i] once
y1[i] = relu(x[i])
y2[i] = sigmoid(x[i])
No copying—just reuse.

✅ A more accurate version of your sentence:
“With one fused kernel, load the input once and compute both functions in parallel within the kernel.”

If that matches what you meant, then yes—that’s exactly what XLA is doing.

You said:
how many times is it stored on the gpu?
ChatGPT said:
In a multi-output fused kernel (like the sibling fusion case), the input tensor is typically stored on the GPU only once — in its original buffer. Here’s how it works step by step:

✅ 1. Single global memory buffer
The input tensor (say x) lives in one allocation in GPU global memory. Fusion does not duplicate that buffer.

Global memory:
x  → one buffer
✅ 2. Each thread loads the input element once
For each element index i, a GPU thread:

Loads x[i] from global memory one time

Keeps it in a register (or sometimes shared memory) temporarily

Uses that value to compute multiple outputs

Example inside the fused kernel:

val = x[i]          # 1 load
y1[i] = relu(val)   # uses register value
y2[i] = sigmoid(val)
✅ No extra storage
✅ No extra reads
✅ No extra GPU memory duplication

✅ 3. Outputs are written to separate buffers
Even though the computation happens in one kernel, the outputs still go to their own destinations:

y1 → its buffer
y2 → its buffer
These buffers did not require copying the input — only writing final results.

✅ So the final answer:
🔹 The input tensor is stored only once on the GPU.
No duplication happens due to fusion. The benefit comes from:

Avoiding multiple reads of the same element

Avoiding multiple kernel launches

Keeping the value in registers instead of reloading

If you're asking about a specific fusion pattern (e.g., with shared memory or tiling), I can walk you through that too — just let me know!

You said:
How is that different than this?

ning optimizer phase (e.g., Adam optimizer and L2Loss,
etc.) typically has many small kernels as a result of applying
the same formula on many training parameters (or variables
in Tensorflow). Fusing these small kernels, hence, provides
performance gain. This fusion style provides an important
2https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/compiler/
xla/service/instruction fusion.cc#L62
advantage that kernels of different shapes can be horizontally
fused3
. For example, consider a multiply operation and an
add operation with separate input shapes, but their output is
consumed by a common operation, here horizontal fusion is
triggered.
ChatGPT said:
You're comparing two different fusion concepts in XLA, and it's great you're noticing the distinction. Here's the breakdown:

✅ 1. What we were previously talking about:
✅ Sibling Multi-Output Fusion
This applies when multiple ops share the same input (same shape).

Example:

y1 = relu(x)
y2 = sigmoid(x)
Same input (x)
✅ So they can be fused into one kernel, producing multiple outputs:

fused(x) -> (relu(x), sigmoid(x))
✔ Input is read once
✔ Outputs come out separately
✔ Shapes must match (same tensor extent)

✅ 2. What the new excerpt describes:
✅ Horizontal Fusion (shape-disjoint fusion)
This is different and more general. It fuses independent kernels that:

Do not share shapes

Operate on different parameter tensors

Have no direct data dependency

Are part of the same phase (e.g., optimizer update)

Eventually feed into the same downstream workload

This is especially useful in optimizers like Adam, SGD, weight decay, etc.

Example:

p1 = w1 * 0.9
p2 = w2 + grad
# Different shapes, different tensors
Without horizontal fusion:

Two separate tiny kernels:

One loops over w1_shape

Another loops over w2_shape

With horizontal fusion (in XLA):

One combined kernel launches

It internally contains two loops, one per tensor

Each loop runs separately but under one GPU launch

✅ Reduces kernel launch overhead
✅ Increases GPU occupancy
✅ Doesn't require shared shapes or inputs
✅ Does not mean shared registers or memory reuse

✅ Key Differences Between the Two
Aspect	Multi-Output (Sibling) Fusion	Horizontal Fusion (Optimizer-style)
Input shape	Must be identical	Can be completely different
Input tensor	Often shared	Usually different
Outputs	Multiple outputs from same op	Separate outputs unrelated
Goal	Avoid redundant reads	Reduce kernel launch overhead
Fusion logic	Graph/dataflow-driven	Backend scheduling/packing
Typical use	Elementwise ops	Optimizer updates, loss terms
✅ So to directly answer your question:
How is multi-output sibling fusion different from the horizontal fusion in optimizers like Adam?

Here’s the core distinction:

✅ Sibling Multi-Output Fusion

Ops operate over the same tensor shape

They share the same input(s)

Fused into one loop

Input is read once → reused

✅ Optimizer-Style Horizontal Fusion

Ops work on different parameters (different shapes)

No shared input or data dependency

Fused to launch one kernel containing multiple separate loops

Purpose: eliminate kernel launch overhead, not memory reuse

There are no shared buffers or reusing inputs in optimizer-style horizontal fusion — each op still loads its own tensor, but they run under a single GPU kernel "umbrella" to avoid launching many tiny kernels.

If you'd like, I can illustrate both styles with pseudocode — just say the word!

You said:

### Instruction fusion:

Simple vertical operation fusion

ex.

python
# Bad
A = matmul(x,y)
B = add(A,b)
C = ReLU(A,B) 

# GOOD
C = ReLU(add(matmul(x,y),b))


Reverse post order traversal to find if functions should be fused:
- Expensive operations not fused (convolution, sort, all reduce, etc.)
- Checks if fused kernel would be too large for GPU hardware
- Will fused kernel cause nested loop?
- Handles issues of threads per block, shared memory per block, threads per sm

### Fusion Merger
- Vertical fusion of the previous instruction fusions  


### Multi-Output Fusion
- With one fused kernel, load the input once into memory (save to reg) and compute both functions in parallel within the kernel

### Horizontal Fusion
Unrelated kernels are sent to gpu to operate parallel

is this a good explaination?
ChatGPT said:
You're very close — the structure is solid — but a few clarifications will make it accurate and technically correct. Here’s what’s right, what needs tweaking, and how to revise it cleanly.

✅ ✅ What you got right
Your breakdown into four phases is good:

Instruction Fusion (vertical, producer→consumer)

Fusion Merger (merging fusion nodes)

Multi-Output Fusion

Horizontal Fusion

And your examples and intent are generally correct.

❗ What needs fixing or tightening
✅ 1. Instruction Fusion
Mostly accurate — but one correction:

❌ "Handles issues of threads per block, shared memory per block, threads per sm"
✅ That’s not done here — those are backend lowering concerns handled after fusion, not in the fusion pass itself.

So keep the bullets about:

Reverse post-order traversal

Avoiding expensive ops

Avoiding massive fused kernels

Avoiding nested loops
✅ But remove the hardware-specific resource scheduling bit — that’s later.

✅ 2. Fusion Merger
Your current line:

“Vertical fusion of the previous instruction fusions”

This is not quite right. It’s not about vertical fusion again — it's about merging already-created fusion instructions where profitable.

A better line:

"Merges existing fusion kernels into larger fused kernels when safe (e.g., to reduce memory writes and kernel launches)."

It operates after instruction fusion and doesn’t just do vertical fusing again — it fuses fusion nodes with their consumers.

✅ 3. Multi-Output Fusion
Your sentence:

“With one fused kernel, load the input once into memory (save to reg) and compute both functions in parallel within the kernel”

✅ This is correct for sibling fusion (when shapes and inputs match), but Multi-Output Fusion also includes producer-consumer fusion, not just sibling ops.

Better phrasing:

"Allows one fused kernel to produce multiple outputs — either from sibling ops (shared inputs) or producer-consumer chains — reducing global memory reads."

✅ 4. Horizontal Fusion
Your line:

“Unrelated kernels are sent to gpu to operate parallel”

This is too simplified — and a bit misleading. It's not about sending independent kernels separately — it's about packing multiple small, independent GPU kernels into one fused kernel.

Correct version:

"Fuses independent kernels (often with different shapes) into a single GPU launch to reduce kernel launch overhead, especially in optimizers like Adam."

They don’t run as separate kernels — they run inside one kernel, each on its own loop/section.

✅ Cleaned-up final version (corrected, concise)
Here’s your explanation with precise wording:

✅ Instruction Fusion
Simple vertical (producer → consumer) fusion of ops.

Example:

# Before
A = matmul(x,y)
B = add(A,b)
C = relu(B)

# After
C = relu(add(matmul(x,y), b))
Reverse post-order traversal is used to decide whether to fuse:

Skips expensive or unfusible ops (e.g., convolution, sort, all-reduce)

Avoids creating kernels that are too large

Avoids nested parallel loops

✅ Fusion Merger
Looks at fusion instructions created earlier and merges them into larger fused kernels when safe

Helps reduce kernel launches and memory traffic

✅ Multi-Output Fusion
Creates a single fused kernel that returns multiple outputs

Works in two cases:

Sibling ops that share the same input

Producer-consumer chains with multiple outputs

Loads shared inputs once and computes all outputs inside the same kernel

✅ Horizontal Fusion
Fuses unrelated kernels (even with different shapes and tensors) into one GPU launch

Common in optimizer updates (e.g., Adam)

Goal: reduce launch overhead and improve GPU utilization, not reuse inputs
